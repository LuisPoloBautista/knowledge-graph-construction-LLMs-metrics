    <h1>Workflow for knowledge graph-construction using LLMs and metrics</h1>
</div>

This repository, KG-LLM-Metrics, provides a comprehensive workflow for building knowledge graphs (KGs) using large language models (LLMs) in a zero-shot approach. It includes methods for generating, evaluating, and optimizing knowledge graphs while leveraging a robust metrics framework that is designed to analyze the topological structure of the graph and assess the quality of the information relative to the original corpus, thereby achieving a more accurate and consistent representation of the extracted knowledge.
